# Smart-Home-Automation
Home automation system using IoT, MQTT, React.js, and Node.js involves several steps, including setting up the hardware, backend, and frontend.

Here's a detailed description of how you can build such a system:

*1. Hardware Setup*
Components:
Microcontroller: ESP32/ESP8266
Sensors: Temperature, humidity, motion, etc.
Actuators: Relays for controlling lights, fans, etc.
WiFi Network: To connect your devices to the internet.


*2. MQTT Broker*
MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight messaging protocol for small sensors and mobile devices.
Setup:
Install an MQTT broker such as Mosquitto on a server or a Raspberry Pi.
sh
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
Configure Mosquitto by editing the configuration file (/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf) to allow remote connections and set up authentication if needed.


*3. Backend:*
Node.js Server
A Node.js server to handle communication between the frontend and the MQTT broker.
